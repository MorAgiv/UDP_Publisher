The publisher does two main things:
1) recieves subscribtipns 2) publishes shapes.
there is an infinite loop that as long as the program is running does this:
In order to 1) recieve subscriptions, it listens on a specific port to the subscribers that send there the relevant
port number they intend to use and the shapes they want to recieve (squares alone or squares & circles).
2) publishes the shapes at the relevant frequency to all the relevant ports
